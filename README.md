# My Next Step Forward — Coaching with Miriam

This is a simple, responsive static website scaffold for Miriam Baer's coaching practice and upcoming workshop series "Accepting the People Around Us." The site is intentionally calm and compassionate in its visual style.

What’s included
- `index.html` — Home
- `about.html` — About Miriam
- `workshops.html` — Workshop details and registration CTAs
- `contact.html` — Contact details + quick form
- `css/style.css` — Styles
- `js/main.js` — Minimal interactivity for modal and forms
- `assets/logo.svg` — Small logo placeholder

Local preview
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or serve via a static server).

Quick deployment notes
- This is a static site and works well hosted on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static file host.
- For real registrations & payments: integrate Stripe (or another provider). The registration form in `index.html` is a placeholder and should be wired to your backend or a registration provider.

Customization
- Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts in the head of each page. Replace or adjust to match your brand.
- Colors and spacing live in `css/style.css`.

If you want, I can:
- Integrate Stripe checkout placeholder or payment links
- Add Netlify / GitHub Actions deployment config
- Wire the registration form to a Google Form, Airtable, or a small serverless endpoint
